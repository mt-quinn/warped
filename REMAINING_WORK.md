# Remaining Work for "Warped"
    
## Phase 2 - Return to Earth

### 1. Game Design
- **Concept:** This phase will begin after the player has successfully taken control of the entire starship, specifically the FTL system. The gameplay will shift from internal ship management to a larger-scale strategic game focused on the return to Earth.
- **Mechanics:** We need to design the core mechanics for this phase. This will include:
    - Storing tables of actual populations of every major city and district on earth (probably sourced from wikipedia)
    - Allowing the player to choose a city as their starting city
    - Replace the Pod Bay view with what appears to be a solid green block, but is actually a collection of tiny dots representing every person in that city
    - The player then clicks any point in the green block to place the first infected
    - By default, infection will spread by 1 new infected/second
    - Each new infected will increase the rate of spread by 0.1 infected/second
    - Upgrade systems revolve around skyrocketing the rate of infection to infect the whole city, then the whole district, then the whole country, then the whole planet. These systems are earth-based, like infected research labs, nuclear power plants, government buildings, etc.
    - Upgrades can allow the player to place more infection points to increase the rate of infection
